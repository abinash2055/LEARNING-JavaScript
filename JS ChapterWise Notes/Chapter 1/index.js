// var and let both are used as similar to declare a variable but they have some differences

let a = 67; // a is a variable contains 67 which is literal valuw
console.log(a);
a = "Abinash Nath Pandey"; // variable a changes to string from integer due to runtime (dynamic changes)
console.log(a);

// JS is case sensitive
