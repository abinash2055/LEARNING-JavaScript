"JavaScript is a popular, high-level programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic websites. It enables web developers to add functionality like animations, form validation, and event handling. JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance user experience and is supported by all modern browsers.

In addition to front-end development, JavaScript also powers back-end services through environments like Node.js, making it a full-stack language. With a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like React, Angular, and Vue), JavaScript is essential for building scalable and efficient web applications."
